# song_prediction
I used the machine-learning approaches we've studied to to train and validate a model for this problem. The training data consists of around 1,900 songs from the 2000's taken from the Million Songs Datasets created by Columbia University cross-referenced with the list of Billboard Top 100 Hits. Each song is characterized by audio features (such as danceability, wordiness, and tempo) extracted from the Spotify API.
